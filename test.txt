Como on now Sephora, even Claire's doesn't do this wtf...
Cute and fun thanks a lot.
Ok guys, I think I just got the best make up ever.
How can you sell such low quality products and not get sued??
THIS IS SOOOO BAD LMAAAOOOO
Cute for kids, my niece loves it.
The colors of the pallets are off, just terrible design overall
You only sell light skin colors? Now that's racist af.
Ok...not as bad as I expected
The glosses look great, but why was this invented in the first place? Terrible product.
